In my latest project, I had used my Java programming skills to design and develop a console-based Hangman game: one of those classic word-guessing games. This has proved to be an excellent learning experience in general, in terms of problem-solving and deepening the understanding of most of the basic control structures, arrays, as well as user input processing.

To begin with, I researched the game's rules and mechanics, which helped me outline the program's structure. I utilized an array to store a list of potential words, from which the program randomly selects one for the player to guess. This reinforced my knowledge of arrays and randomness in Java.

Next, I implemented a character array to represent the current state of the guessed word, initializing it with underscores to indicate unguessed letters. This visual representation allowed players to see their progress and engage with the game dynamically. I incorporated a loop that runs until the player either guesses the word or exhausts their attempts, showcasing my understanding of control flow in Java.

To enhance the user experience, I implemented feedback mechanisms, including prompts for letter input and messages indicating correct or incorrect guesses. I also included a graphical representation of the Hangman using ASCII art, which added an interactive element to the game and reinforced my skills in string manipulation.

Lastly, I made sure my code was modular, with a separate method for the Hangman drawing according to the number of attempts remaining. This not only improved readability, but it also facilitated easier debugging and future modifications.

In general, the whole undertaking was both a test of my technical skills in Java and honed the ability to apply logical thinking and problem-solving strategies in practical contexts.
